* Install nodejs.
 https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
* Required libraries:
    * crypto-js

## Usage:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open terminal/command prompt and traverse to the repo.
3. We need to import the required libraries. Run the following command:
    `npm i crypto-js`

4. Now we run the file.
```
node {filename}.js
```
5. You will be displayed with the state of the chain!
